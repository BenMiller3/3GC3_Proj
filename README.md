# McMaster 3D Runner
========================
Please help me come up with a better title.

A 3D runner game made with OpenGL and GLUT. The basis of this game is a runner attempting to escape a world. This game will allow the player to control an average McMaster Software Engineering student who has to escape the McMaster campus while collecting bonus marks and grace periods to save their GPA, along with other additional power ups. They also have to avoid instructors, teaching assistants, assignments, tests, and much more throughout their journey. Building this game and the world in which it takes place will be a challenging yet fruitful experience. The project will allow this team to experiment with building a 3D environment, wireframing for character development, and the ability to manipulate and recreate realistic physics.

## Features
=============
This is a project of substantial difficulty, as it contains various features. If the project is not daunting enough already, there are optional additional features that will be implemented if time allows. By utilizing OpenGL and GLUT this concept game is more than possible. With different lighting techniques, camera angles, tile textures for the background and more, this team will be able to create a beautiful and enticing world, along with a realistic and engaging, playable McMaster student.
